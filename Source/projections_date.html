               <p>Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond
                  is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession,
                  he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where
                  he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides
                  to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist
                  cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend,
                  Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's
                  terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning
                  to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6
                  assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy
                  his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd.
                  At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens
                  as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro,
                  Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing
                  the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence,
                  raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.

                                       <p>Mads Mikkelsen is a synonym to the great success the Danish film industry has had
                                          since the mid-1990s. Starting out as a low-life pusher/junkie in the 1996 success
                                          _Pusher (1996)_ (qv), he slowly grew to become one of Denmark's biggest movie actors.
                                          The success in his home country includes _Blinkende lygter (2000)_ (qv), _En kort
                                          en lang (2001)_ (qv) and the Emmy-winning police series _"Rejseholdet" (2000)_ (qv).
                                          His success has taken him abroad where he has played alongside 'Gérard Depardieu'
                                          (qv) in _I Am Dina (2002)_ (qv) as well as in the Spanish comedy _Torremolinos 73

                                       <p>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as
                                          a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as "James Bond" in _Casino
                                          Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv). He
                                          was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire,
                                          England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became
                                          landlord of "Ring O' Bells" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig,
                                          was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised
                                          with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of
                                          his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman
                                          Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school
                                          plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of "Oliver!", and
                                          his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie
                                          he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv);
                                          young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart.
                                          He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club. At the age
                                          of 14, Craig played roles in "Oliver", "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella" at Hilbre
                                          High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the
                                          National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was
                                          accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage
                                          debut as "Agamemnon" in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida". As a struggling actor
                                          with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed
                                          with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership
                                          of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall,
                                          but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School
                                          of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv)
                                          and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes'
                                          (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage
                                          of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From
                                          1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named
                                          'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power
                                          of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial
                                          _"Our Friends in the North" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing
                                          supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_
                                          (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_
                                          (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor
                                          to portray "James Bond", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich
                                          (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of
                                          'Steven Spielberg' (qv). Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet
                                          milieu makes him a cool "007". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also
                                          the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be
                                          born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond
                                          actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce
                                          Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as "Bond".

                                       <p>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation,
                                          Jeffrey Wright's undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role
                                          he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business.
                                          Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college
                                          in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school
                                          with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after
                                          graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months
                                          to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway
                                          production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within
                                          a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability
                                          on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996
                                          in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the
                                          late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy
                                          and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the
                                          intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near
                                          future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright
                                          can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity
                                          of his skill.

                                       <p>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents:
                                          a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary
                                          and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years
                                          and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting
                                          poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made
                                          two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius
                                          University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale
                                          by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The
                                          Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in
                                          television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the
                                          communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of
                                          the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz
                                          band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of
                                          a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known
                                          in fact as "the hospital murderer". In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic
                                          The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation
                                          of stories of one's line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.

                                          has a younger brother, Tomo Milicevic. The family emigrated to the United States,
                                          and young Ivana Milicevic was raised in Michigan. She attended Athens High school
                                          in Troy, Michigan, and worked as a model during her school years. She became a naturalized
                                          citizen of the United States. In 1992, Milicevic graduated from high school and moved
                                          to Los Angeles in pursuit of an acting career. She was a struggling stand-up comedienne,
                                          trying to win over crowds with her stories of the modeling business. In 1996, she
                                          made her film debut under the name Ivana Marina with a one-line role as a Former Girlfriend
                                          of 'Tom Cruise' (qv) in _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv). In 1997, she followed up with
                                          a guest role on NBC's _"Seinfeld" (1989)_ (qv) and made guest appearances on several
                                          other television shows. She played bit parts in _Vanilla Sky (2001)_ (qv) and _Love
                                          Actually (2003)_ (qv), among her many other cameo appearances. Milicevic capitalized
                                          on her experience as a comedienne in a supporting role as Russian model Roxana Milla
                                          Slasnikova in the romantic comedy _Head Over Heels (2001)_ (qv). She appeared as a
                                          lookalike of 'Uma Thurman' (qv) opposite 'Ben Affleck' (qv), trying to fool him into
                                          thinking she is Uma, in _Paycheck (2003)_ (qv). In a departure from her one-dimensional
                                          roles, Milicevic showed her dramatic talent in a supporting role as Milla Yugorsky
                                          in a dark and gritty drama _Running Scared (2006)_ (qv). In 2006, she started a recurring
                                          role on the CBS TV series _"Love Monkey" (2006)_ (qv). In 2006, Milicevic made a big
                                          step forward in her career appearing as Valenka, one of three Bond girls in _Casino
                                          Royale (2006)_ (qv), for which she did most of her scenes on locations in Prague and
                                          in London. She is currently residing in Los Angeles, California.

                                       <p>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical
                                          twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film
                                          _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, 'Marlène Jobert' (qv), is an actress
                                          who retired from acting and became a writer of children's books. Eva's mother was
                                          born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of
                                          France), and Eva's father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school
                                          at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School
                                          in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for
                                          three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic
                                          Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York
                                          University. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on
                                          stage in several theater productions: "La Jalousie en Trois Fax" and "Turcaret". There
                                          she caught the eye of director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). Green followed a recommendation
                                          to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing
                                          _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). During their work Bertolucci
                                          described Green as being "so beautiful it's indecent." Green won critical acclaim
                                          for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention
                                          from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides
                                          her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound
                                          tracks for the film score. After The Dreamers Green's career ascended to the level
                                          where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest
                                          of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Romain Duris'
                                          (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite 'Orlando Bloom' (qv) and 'Liam Neeson' (qv)
                                          in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by 'Ridley Scott' (qv). The
                                          film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale
                                          role in The Black Dahlia that went to 'Hilary Swank' (qv) because she didn't want
                                          to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead,
                                          Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite
                                          'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress
                                          to play a James Bond girl after 'Claudine Auger' (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv),
                                          'Corinne Cléry (I)' (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), 'Carole Bouquet' (qv) in _For
                                          Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and 'Sophie Marceau' (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).
                                          Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural
                                          person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she
                                          and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond
                                          her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor.
                                          Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking
                                          at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two
                                          residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.

                                       <p>Her father was a Prussian count (Count von Lehndorff-Steinort) who was involved in
                                          a plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944 and hanged that year, when Vera was three. Her
                                          mother was arrested, and Vera and her sisters spent the rest of the war in Gestapo
                                          camps. They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute,
                                          and ostracised by other Germans for their father's treachery. She ended up studying
                                          textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model. She
                                          had first travelled to New York in 1961 as plain old Vera, but failed to secure a
                                          single booking. After retreating to Milan for a spell, she returned to take Manhattan
                                          under her new name.... Veruschka!

                                          films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces.
                                          He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College
                                          (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he
                                          mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and
                                          edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for
                                          how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS
                                          (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera
                                          assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young
                                          DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing,
                                          he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in
                                          front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately
                                          he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this
                                          year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.

               <p>1986 - Soviet Russia has been arming international terrorists with chemical weapon
                  technology, and a chemical weapons plant in the mountains is the target of James Bond
                  and his closest compatriot, Alec Trevelyan. Infiltrating the compound, they are spotted
                  and Alec is captured. When a ruthless Soviet officer, Oromov, executes Trevelyan,
                  James pulls off a spectacular escape and succeeds in blowing up the compound. Now
                  in 1995, he is assigned to tail former Red Air Force jet jockey Xenia Onatopp, who
                  is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop
                  her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility
                  by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic
                  responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she
                  goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs
                  over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as
                  Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye
                  system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate,
                  which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet
                  army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet
                  missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.

                                       <p>Famke Beumer Janssen was born on November 5, 1964 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and has
                                          two other siblings. She studied economics for a year at the University of Amsterdam.
                                          Moving to America in 1984, Famke modeled for Chanel in New York City. Later, taking
                                          a break from modeling, she majored in writing and literature at Columbia University
                                          and studied acting with 'Harold Guskin' (qv). She then went to Los Angeles, California,
                                          where she continued to study acting under 'Roy London' (qv). Her first film was the
                                          crime drama _Fathers &amp; Sons (1992)_ (qv), where she played the love interest of 'Jeff
                                          Goldblum' (qv). Later, she became James Bond's enemy in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) opposite
                                          'Pierce Brosnan' (qv). Famke received strong critical acclaim for her electrifying
                                          performance as the femme fatale Xenia Onatopp. Her career has bloomed since then with
                                          her starring in such films as _House on Haunted Hill (1999)_ (qv), a reoccurring role
                                          on FX's _"Nip/Tuck" (2003)_ (qv) and the blockbuster trilogy _X-Men (2000)_ (qv),
                                          _X2 (2003)_ (qv), and _X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)_ (qv).

                                       <p>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support
                                          in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself
                                          noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and
                                          then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall
                                          (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption
                                          &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing
                                          a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick
                                          (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed
                                          the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which
                                          led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied"
                                          (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy
                                          roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians
                                          etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a
                                          meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in
                                          _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films

                                       <p>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer.
                                          In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked
                                          up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him
                                          from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for
                                          Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test,
                                          and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also
                                          failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for
                                          the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn
                                          thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and
                                          meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his
                                          acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid
                                          1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and
                                          Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned
                                          to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time,
                                          his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division
                                          of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and
                                          many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side,
                                          figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones
                                          there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At
                                          one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next
                                          morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation
                                          of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it,
                                          a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing
                                          of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other
                                          people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to
                                          London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia
                                          with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions
                                          Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live
                                          and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli'
                                          (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down.
                                          Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_
                                          (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of
                                          _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film,
                                          _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical
                                          abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd
                                          love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they
                                          should have put me out to grass a long time ago."

                                          going for sports - ice hockey, boxing and soccer among them. After completing his
                                          2 years national service in the Soviet Air Force, Ravil worked for two seasons in

                                       <p>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating
                                          society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two

                                          cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12
                                          he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry
                                          V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).
                                          He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied
                                          art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a
                                          documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the
                                          Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his
                                          love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh
                                          Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre. In 1980
                                          Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The
                                          Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in
                                          _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as
                                          Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director
                                          'Amos Poe' (qv). He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip
                                          series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_
                                          (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane
                                          had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew
                                          to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years,
                                          Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn. In 1988 Coltrane
                                          met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer,
                                          and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading
                                          role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series
                                          _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv). He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB
                                          man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called
                                          him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane
                                          hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv)
                                          as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films. In early
                                          1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred
                                          in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges
                                          his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey
                                          across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His
                                          interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding
                                          and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire,
                                          Scotland, UK.

                                       <p>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England
                                          domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley
                                          114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University
                                          and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow
                                          Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting.
                                          On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in 'Richard III'), the
                                          Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in 'As You Like It', Edgar in 'King Lear')in 'The Caretaker'
                                          at the Bristol Old Vic, 'Live Like Pigs' at the Royal Court and 'The Park' with the
                                          Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.
                                          On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have
                                          played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.

                                       <p>Born in the northern Polish town of Bialystok, 'Izabella Scorupco' (qv) moved to Sweden
                                          with her mother as a young child. She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered
                                          by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_
                                          (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden
                                          and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages. In
                                          1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop
                                          singer with her first single, Substitute. The single and subsequent album, IZA, both
                                          went gold, and she followed with another hit single, Shame, Shame, which she recorded
                                          in 1991. Returning to acting in 1994, she immediately won the lead role in the Swedish
                                          film _Petri tårar (1995)_ (qv). Scorupco stars as a woman who lives her life as a
                                          man in the medieval drama, which was released in August 1995.

                                          green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays
                                          angst-ridden villians, as in "Clarissa," passionate lovers like Mellors in "Lady Chatterley's
                                          Lover," rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as
                                          the emotionally torn Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings," and noble Greeks, like Odysseus
                                          in "Troy," where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest
                                          of the movie. Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," where as the principal
                                          lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically
                                          acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of
                                          movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys
                                          raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In
                                          his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK,
                                          and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, "I don't have any problems with women
                                          seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?" Well, good to know, because
                                          his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.

                                       <p>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County
                                          Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability
                                          to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when
                                          Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close
                                          relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The
                                          death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him
                                          with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and
                                          Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second
                                          wife, 'Keely Shaye Smith' (qv).

                                       <p>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived
                                          nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family
                                          (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William
                                          soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan's dad took
                                          up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up.
                                          He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing
                                          in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club
                                          and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and
                                          4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he
                                          worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee.
                                          There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, "Tops", and was also the "Young Alan"
                                          who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the
                                          Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a
                                          B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed
                                          a cabaret double act with fellow student 'Forbes Masson' (qv) called Victor and Barry,
                                          which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of
                                          the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House
                                          as part of an Australian tour), records ("Hear Victor and Barry and Faint", "Are We
                                          Too Loud?") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made
                                          his professional theater and film debuts in "Macbeth" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow
                                          and in 'Gillies MacKinnon' (qv)'s "Passing Glory". After graduating Alan worked extensively
                                          in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _"Take the
                                          High Road" (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when "Conquest of the South Pole",

                                          nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988. Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare

                                          of an Anarchist", which he also adapted with director 'Tim Supple' (qv). The production
                                          was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy

                                          The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor

               <p>In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz meets the slave Django
                  in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if
                  Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him.
                  Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle
                  and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse
                  and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his
                  deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the
                  money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German.
                  Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter,
                  he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts
                  his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh
                  and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives
                  in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure
                  Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily
                  fooled.

                                          Sign Language, and conversational French. She is a classical/Opera singer and has
                                          5 siblings, including a Deaf older brother. Her parents came to the United States
                                          during the 1980s in search of a better future. Years later, she was their first child

                                       <p>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for
                                          herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting
                                          career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature
                                          _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Robert Rodriguez
                                          (I)' (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the
                                          double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next
                                          big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk
                                          them. Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill:
                                          Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for
                                          Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol.
                                          1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World
                                          Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2.
                                          Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle
                                          Barry's _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv). Bell's talent can not only be seen on the big screen
                                          but also in the cult television series _"Xena: Warrior Princess" (1995)_ (qv) where
                                          she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC
                                          thriller _"Alias" (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double
                                          for Vicki Pratti. In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell
                                          along with legendary stunt-woman 'Jeannie Epper' (qv) give an insight into the career
                                          of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse
                                          into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated
                                          career. Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes
                                          to someday own a home in New Zealand.

                                       <p>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular
                                          radio disc jockey on Chicago's number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended
                                          St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the
                                          Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami
                                          with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment
                                          instead. While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of
                                          the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time
                                          as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970's based major
                                          motion picture, "American Gangster." Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time,
                                          Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70's style afro
                                          and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson's eyes and the hairstyle befitting
                                          of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer
                                          alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, "Common Sense." With the successful major
                                          motion picture, "American Gangster" under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself
                                          in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed
                                          by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was "Django
                                          Unchained," and the role was that of the character named, "Blueberry," a slave turned
                                          killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. "Django Unchained" went on the
                                          be Mr. Tarantino's highest grossing film to date. Mr. Hudson still lives in Chicago
                                          Illinois.

                                       <p>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo
                                          wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, "The Candy Store", while attending
                                          college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times
                                          at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down
                                          one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying
                                          a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly,
                                          Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable "tough guy" performer
                                          he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role
                                          in "Extremities" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which
                                          he terrorized 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be.
                                          Other decent roles in films include 'Kevin Costner' (qv)'s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv)
                                          and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We're No Angels
                                          (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number
                                          of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has "Welcome to Andromeda", "Deathwatch", "Marat/Sade"
                                          and the afore-mentioned "Extremities" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite 'Johnny
                                          Depp' (qv) in 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed
                                          mobster "Victor Mura" in TV's short-lived, _"Falcone" (2000)_ (qv), the following
                                          year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in _Stealing
                                          Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).

                                       <p>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of
                                          Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He
                                          is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended
                                          17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his
                                          mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder
                                          of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call
                                          him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has
                                          had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub
                                          called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights
                                          until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes
                                          of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen
                                          Coe, Ray Price, and many others. After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint
                                          in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some
                                          actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with
                                          acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker,
                                          and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because
                                          he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi
                                          and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of
                                          hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The
                                          University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what
                                          he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state
                                          selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered
                                          J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan's
                                          Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer
                                          and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth
                                          between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just
                                          completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.
                                          Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd
                                          Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky
                                          son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films
                                          so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved
                                          true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd
                                          Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won
                                          an artist's print worth $80.

                                       <p>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV
                                          series _"Miami Vice" (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined
                                          the 1980s. As James "Sonny" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps,
                                          prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from
                                          1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced
                                          by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv),
                                          paired Johnson with the equally cool 'Philip Michael Thomas' (qv) as Det. Ricardo
                                          Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of 'Edward James Olmos' (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo.
                                          It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and
                                          use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss
                                          suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari
                                          Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named "St. Vitus' Dance" with
                                          his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, "Miami
                                          Vice" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned
                                          vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on
                                          "Miami Vice" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series
                                          in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an
                                          Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985. Johnson was
                                          born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted
                                          to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young
                                          age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into
                                          films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other
                                          things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During
                                          the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled;
                                          the names of his first two wives have never been made public. 'Tippi Hedren' (qv),
                                          Johnson's co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her
                                          daughter 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was
                                          22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s
                                          he lived with actress 'Patti D'Arbanville' (qv) and they had one son together. He
                                          remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for 'Antonio Banderas'
                                          (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have
                                          three children together. Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his
                                          career-high role on "Miami Vice", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed
                                          four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith.
                                          He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film
                                          _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the 'William Faulkner (I)'
                                          (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with 'Susan Sarandon' (qv).
                                          After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like
                                          _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro
                                          Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained
                                          a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions
                                          to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary
                                          filmmakers like 'John Frankenheimer' (qv), 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper'
                                          (qv). After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _"Nash
                                          Bridges" (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well.
                                          It co-starred 'Cheech Marin' (qv) and 'Jodi Lyn O'Keefe' (qv). Johnson played the
                                          title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was
                                          again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda
                                          convertible. After "Nash Bridges" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but
                                          continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom
                                          drama _"Just Legal" (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv),
                                          and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange
                                          flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno
                                          a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in
                                          Rome (2010)_ (qv) with 'Anjelica Huston' (qv) and 'Danny DeVito' (qv), as well as

                                       <p>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as
                                          a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following
                                          among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the "splatter movie"
                                          explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends 'Dick Smith
                                          (II)' (qv) and 'Rob Bottin' (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the
                                          startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s.
                                          Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor 'Lon Chaney' (qv),
                                          and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark
                                          of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book "Grande Illusions", he speaks of his
                                          early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using "spearmint gum", having misinterpreted
                                          that he was meant to actually use "spirit gum"! His first work was in low-budget fare,
                                          providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_
                                          (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs
                                          with his grisly effects in the cult 'George A. Romero (I)' (qv)-directed zombie film
                                          _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday
                                          the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned
                                          "splatter movie" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other
                                          splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow
                                          (1982)_ (qv) and Romero's third "Dead" film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which
                                          he won a Saturn Award). In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of
                                          the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content
                                          with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films,
                                          and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as "Morgan, the Black Knight"
                                          in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as "Blades", one of the biker gang members in _Dawn
                                          of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as "Sex Machine", another leather-clad biker--but this
                                          time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_
                                          (qv).

                                       <p>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz,
                                          a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother
                                          was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow
                                          Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse
                                          in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to
                                          New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first
                                          wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London. During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily
                                          in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work
                                          in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however,
                                          attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has
                                          stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting.
                                          For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner. It was not until
                                          he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel
                                          Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in
                                          German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning
                                          actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix
                                          d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and
                                          the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award. Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles.
                                          His partner is the costume builder Judith Holste.

                                          (qv). That same year he garnered acclaim on Broadway with 'Richard Gere' (qv) in the
                                          concentration camp drama "Bent". In a career spanning nearly four decades, James has

                                          garnered roles which highlight a more vulnerable side, such as his guitarist who gets

                                       <p>Franco Nero, a leading actor in international cinema, was born in Parma (Northern
                                          Italy). His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years
                                          when he began organizing and participating in student plays. After a short stint at
                                          a leading theater school, he moved to Rome where he joined a small group of friends
                                          for the purpose of making some documentaries. Still unsure of his ultimate vocation,
                                          he worked various jobs on the crew. The role as Abel in John Houston's film "The Bible"
                                          marked a crucial point in his career. A few months later he had his big break with
                                          the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western "Django". The following
                                          year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of "Camelot" (Warner Bros.), opposite
                                          Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. Nero has appeared
                                          in more than 195 movies around the world and has worked with Europe's top directors,
                                          such as Luis Bunuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Bondarciuk,
                                          Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, just to mention
                                          a few. He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as "Garibaldi"
                                          (Italy), "Arpad" (Hungary", "Banovic Strahinja" (Yugoslavia). In the USA he has been
                                          in successful mini-series such as "The Pirate" (Warner Bros), "The Last Days of Pompeii"
                                          (CBS), "Young Catherine" (TNT), "Bella Mafia" (CBS), "The Painted Lady", "Saint Augustine",
                                          and movies such as "The Legend of Valentino", "21 Hours to Munich", "Force 10 from
                                          Navarone", "Enter the Ninja", "The Versace Murder", "Die Hard 2", and recently "Letters
                                          to Juliet". At the beginning of the 80's, he also began producing, writing and directing.
                                          Between films, he participates in various theatrical events. Over the last 45 years
                                          he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli. He has received many
                                          awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was
                                          bestowed on him by the President of Italy. In 2011 he was honored by Brunel University
                                          of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and in Toronto
                                          with a star on the walk of fame.

                                       <p>Walton Goggins received an Emmy® nomination and two Broadcast Television Journalists
                                          Association (BTJA) nominations for Best Supporting Actor for his role as 'Boyd Crowder'
                                          on FX's Peabody Award-winning Drama series Justified. Goggins reprised his turn as
                                          the transgender escort 'Venus Van Dam' (a play on his character Shane's alias of 'Cletus
                                          Van Damme' on The Shield) on the highly-rated FX drama series Sons of Anarchy. The
                                          role reunites Goggins with series creator Kurt Sutter who was also a writer on The
                                          Shield. Goggins completed production on writer/director William Monahan's Mojave with
                                          Garrett Hedlund and Oscar Issacs. He plays 'Jim,' an entertainment lawyer experiencing
                                          an existential crisis. He has also completed production on writer/director Ross Clarke's
                                          adaptation of Craig Clevenger's novel Dermaphoria. Goggins plays 'Eliah Blanc,' a
                                          wealthy New Orleanian whose pastimes include the funding of meth labs. Goggins has
                                          had pivotal roles in films by two of Hollywood's most important auteurs: Quentin Tarantino,
                                          in Django Unchained; and Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. He also appeared in such diverse
                                          films as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, Robert Rodriguez's Predators and Machete Kills,
                                          Jon Favreau's Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs. Goggins previously garnered
                                          much acclaim for his complex and edgy portrayal of 'Detective Shane Vendrell' on FX's
                                          gritty, award-winning drama series The Shield. In 2009, he was nominated for a Television
                                          Critics Association (TCA) Award in the category of "Individual Achievement in Drama."
                                          In the last ten years, Goggins has also taken his turn behind the camera. He recently
                                          collaborated with writer Adam Fierro ("The Shield") on the pilot "Gringo" which sold
                                          to FOX. Goggins' prior collaborations with his partners at Ginny Mule Pictures include
                                          winning an Academy Award® for their short film, The Accountant, which he produced
                                          and starred in. The team produced, directed and starred in their first feature, Chrystal,
                                          starring Billy Bob Thornton, which was accepted into the 2005 Sundance Film Festival's
                                          Dramatic Competition. For their third collaboration, Goggins produced and starred
                                          in the feature Randy and the Mob, which won the Audience Award for Best Feature at
                                          the 2007 Nashville Film Festival. Goggins and his Ginny Mule partners completed their
                                          fourth feature, That Evening Sun, starring Hal Holbrook and Goggins. The film made
                                          its world premiere at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin, TX in
                                          March 2009, where it won the Narrative Feature Audience Award and received the Special
                                          Jury Award for "Best Ensemble Cast." The film continued winning awards at over 14
                                          film festivals, culminating with the honor of the "Wyatt Award" from the Southeastern
                                          Film Critics Association (SEFCA) and two Independent Spirit Award nominations. Goggins
                                          also takes time to lend a hand to various non-profit organizations and has joined
                                          forces with City Hearts, whose focus is bringing the arts to underfunded schools.
                                          He has also worked closely with Global Green USA, which is committed to sustainable
                                          development and the legislation to support it. He enjoys traveling the world and has
                                          spent time in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Central America, Morocco and India last
                                          spring. Goggins is an avid photographer and has captured many of his journeys on film.

                                       <p>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating
                                          back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing:
                                          be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14
                                          years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program's long-time,
                                          late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette,
                                          she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in
                                          a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw
                                          Shakespeare in the Park's Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program
                                          and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually
                                          she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did
                                          background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana
                                          has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland,
                                          Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark's, The Cherry Lane Theater,
                                          Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart
                                          of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned
                                          playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan
                                          Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands. In 2010, Dana
                                          completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where
                                          she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions
                                          both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into
                                          Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal
                                          when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO's Treme; the David Simon executively
                                          produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring
                                          role. Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest Academy Award Winners
                                          and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino's
                                          Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas
                                          about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot,
                                          but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working
                                          with Nominee Lee Daniels' on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen
                                          Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz. Additionally, Dana has
                                          worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo
                                          DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica
                                          Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey! Dana considers herself
                                          Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.

                                          repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that
                                          casting directors capitalized on. 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed
                                          that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World
                                          War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern
                                          had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and
                                          a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of
                                          his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of
                                          _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well. Some critics said
                                          that "Gatsby" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv)
                                          had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother
                                          in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated
                                          and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in "Coming
                                          Home," a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for
                                          the role, then fell victim to the infamous "Oscar curse" that has claimed other winners,
                                          most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's
                                          co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv). Dern, like Young before him,
                                          was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly
                                          as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho,
                                          surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined
                                          to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before "Coming Home." He failed,
                                          and his career suffered. Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films
                                          in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3
                                          (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films
                                          in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or
                                          much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv),
                                          flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor
                                          at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that
                                          picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The
                                          movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged
                                          that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams'
                                          (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed. Although
                                          he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer
                                          Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment
                                          with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later
                                          in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.
                                          Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started
                                          buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved
                                          a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance
                                          for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter,
                                          'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear. Since the 1990 high point of the second
                                          wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated
                                          much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's
                                          premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer
                                          roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys
                                          (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to
                                          escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development
                                          as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom,
                                          trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.

                                       <p>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans,
                                          LA. His most notable role is as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's Oscar-Nominated
                                          film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO's Emmy-Nominated
                                          television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback,
                                          New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees. Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest
                                          of five brothers, to Merline (nee' Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA,
                                          and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine
                                          High School, later receiving his Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning from the University
                                          of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning
                                          and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans. Escalante's
                                          career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up,
                                          Lundy took the role', garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career
                                          path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of
                                          public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by
                                          taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
                                          Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department
                                          of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy's family members were victims of Hurricane
                                          Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city
                                          began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including
                                          focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young
                                          and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television
                                          Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback
                                          Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead
                                          in the production of the "Papaya Man" with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in
                                          New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, "I tried to quit
                                          but Mr. Bean wouldn't let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run" In 2012, Lundy
                                          made his major motion picture debut as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti
                                          western, Django Unchained. Lundy's role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast
                                          of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive
                                          such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting.
                                          Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino
                                          directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.

                                       <p>Carl recently transformed his life's purpose from being a longtime successful Texas
                                          High School football coach and administrator into a flourishing acting career. He
                                          rapidly started appearing in feature films such as the Quentin Tarantino film "Django
                                          Unchained and a host of other features including, "Now You See Me", "Texas Chainsaw
                                          Massacre 3D", and "The Iceman" to name a few. Carl was recently cast as assistant
                                          Coach Alumbaugh in "When The Game Stands Tall" working along side Jim Caviezel and
                                          Michael Chiklis in the high school football film. Carl continues training and working
                                          as much as possible in regional Indie's and small productions to hone his craft, developing

                                       <p>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's.
                                          DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of
                                          the sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters
                                          3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor
                                          in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then
                                          become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors
                                          such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich,
                                          varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring
                                          as DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George
                                          DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father,
                                          George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book
                                          titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical
                                          comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's
                                          performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up
                                          with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams",
                                          DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.
                                          DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles
                                          in a number of television series, such as _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv) and _"The New Lassie"
                                          (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters
                                          3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie. While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little
                                          to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel,
                                          and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_
                                          (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy
                                          who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _"Growing Pains" (1985)_
                                          (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring
                                          DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning
                                          for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took
                                          up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth
                                          in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and
                                          the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date,
                                          "Jim Carroll", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River
                                          Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish
                                          Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in 'Baz Luhrmann'
                                          (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true
                                          movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers,
                                          _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then,
                                          as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time,
                                          and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on _Titanic
                                          (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The
                                          Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being
                                          some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back
                                          into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_
                                          (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director
                                          'Martin Scorsese' (qv). With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is
                                          now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional
                                          career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who
                                          is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue
                                          led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the
                                          natural environment. As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials
                                          to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most
                                          diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types
                                          of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts
                                          in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv)
                                          and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to
                                          wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely
                                          a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring
                                          and challenging actors working today.

                                       <p>Jonah Hill was born and raised in Los Angeles, the son of Sharon (Chalkin), a fashion
                                          designer and costume stylist, and 'Richard Feldstein' (qv), a tour accountant for
                                          'Guns N' Roses' (qv). He graduated from Crossroads School in Santa Monica and went
                                          on to The New School in New York to study drama. He began writing and performing in
                                          plays while at college in New York, and managed to get himself introduced to 'Dustin
                                          Hoffman' (qv), through whom he got an audition for his first film role in _I Heart
                                          Huckabees (2004)_ (qv). A succession of increasingly high profile film and TV parts
                                          followed until he eventually landed one of the starring roles in the teen hit, _Superbad
                                          (2007)_ (qv). Continuing to write and act, more roles followed as well as popular
                                          appearances on US TV talk shows.

                                       <p>Jamie's mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed,
                                          his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted
                                          him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts
                                          and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school
                                          team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music
                                          in college. He released a music album in 1994, "Peep This" and sings the theme song
                                          for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed
                                          when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he
                                          says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference
                                          for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _"Roc" (1991)_ (qv)
                                          and _"In Living Color" (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series.
                                          He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.

                                       <p>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts 'Gregory Peck' (qv), 'Marlon Brando' (qv),
                                          'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and 'Robert
                                          Mitchum' (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.
                                          Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself
                                          fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television.
                                          He is filming the inspirational sports drama, "My All American" written and directed
                                          by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django
                                          Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer
                                          named, "Dollar Bill." In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the
                                          independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger
                                          who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen
                                          remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include
                                          the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _"Friday Night
                                          Lights" (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with 'Robert Duvall' (qv) in Duvall's
                                          Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred
                                          with Duvall again in AMC's Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _"Broken Trail"
                                          (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of "Marshal Bill Miller," a man who carries
                                          severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both
                                          produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense
                                          of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan.
                                          Other career highlights include three films with 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv), three films
                                          with 'Kevin Costner' (qv), and playing fighter ace 'Chuck Yeager' (qv) in a Hallmark
                                          Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television,
                                          including appearances on _"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2000)_ (qv), _"NCIS: Naval
                                          Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv), _"Monk" (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for
                                          Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv). Allen will launch an independent media
                                          and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties
                                          and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans
                                          to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay,
                                          a gritty, film-noir styled Western, "The Deserters", was the subject of much competition
                                          among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring
                                          role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is
                                          now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn't have to
                                          do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, "Suicide Grip,"
                                          a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo
                                          in Las Vegas. "The Empty Quarter," is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well
                                          in Saudi Arabia's most barren desert and "Rio Grande" is based on the best selling
                                          memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger
                                          along the volatile Texas/Mexico border. Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles
                                          and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.

                                       <p>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet "till his last dying day." Indelibly
                                          linked to the "womb to tomb" role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled
                                          gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story
                                          (1961)_ (qv), it's not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed
                                          the teenage troublemaker who became the '50s equivalent of the Mercutio character
                                          in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation. To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely
                                          agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles,
                                          California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age
                                          ten by actor 'Lloyd Bridges (I)' (qv) for the play "Stone Jungle", Russ was soon performing
                                          on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as "Rusty Tamblyn" then, the tousle-haired
                                          scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_
                                          (qv) starring another child actor, 'Dean Stockwell' (qv). Having taken up dancing
                                          and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first
                                          TV appearance on the "The Ed Sullivan Show." Eventually handed a starring role in
                                          the "B" film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who
                                          saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy
                                          _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father's Little Dividend (1951)_
                                          (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_
                                          (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in
                                          one of MGM's best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn's timing
                                          was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A
                                          starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews
                                          in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with
                                          'Lana Turner' (qv), 'Arthur Kennedy (I)' (qv), 'Hope Lange' (qv) and 'Diane Varsi'
                                          (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well
                                          in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone
                                          in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers
                                          started dwindling. Tamblyn's last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas
                                          with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with 'Julie Harris (I)'
                                          (qv) and 'Claire Bloom (I)' (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The
                                          Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring 'Richard Widmark' (qv) and 'Sidney Poitier' (qv).
                                          After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_
                                          (qv), _Satan's Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein
                                          (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road
                                          in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical
                                          "Cabaret," Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed
                                          the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn't on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence
                                          Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv), it was the first
                                          time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with
                                          his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off
                                          this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic
                                          duties and the managing of actress/daughter 'Amber Tamblyn' (qv)'s career, she of
                                          _"Joan of Arcadia" (2003)_ (qv) fame.

                                       <p>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival,
                                          by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim
                                          and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs
                                          success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival,
                                          winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated
                                          for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing
                                          partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay.
                                          In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with
                                          friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv)
                                          and 'Allison Anders' (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to
                                          very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a
                                          vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The
                                          film did fairly well theatrically.

                                       <p>He'll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed,
                                          dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking 'John Schneider (I)' (qv)
                                          was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s
                                          series _"The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV
                                          wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on
                                          and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording
                                          artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows. The highly engaging
                                          Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951.
                                          Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school
                                          graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the
                                          University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and
                                          lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as "South Pacific",
                                          "West Side Story" and "Jesus Christ Superstar". Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before
                                          making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical "I
                                          Love My Wife", other book shows came his way including "The Robber Bridegroom" and
                                          the lead in "Oklahoma!" With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take
                                          long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes
                                          directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider
                                          wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons,
                                          although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations
                                          broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn't the same without them and they eventually
                                          were brought back. During the show's run, Tom kick-started his recording career with
                                          his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include
                                          six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.
                                          After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and
                                          a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)' ex-husband/stuntman
                                          on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills.
                                          He returned with commanding baritone leads in "Carousel" (1986), "City of Angels"
                                          (1990) and "Guys and Dolls" (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting
                                          Frank Butler role opposite 'Bernadette Peters' (qv) in the popular Broadway revival
                                          of "Annie Get Your Gun" and earned a Tony nomination in the process. It's only gotten
                                          sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras
                                          in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, he has continued on the New York stage
                                          with successive roles in "42nd Street" and "Chicago" (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn).
                                          In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part
                                          of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for "Best Revival of a Play") production
                                          of "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring acting heavyweights 'Alan Alda' (qv) and 'Liev Schreiber'
                                          (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national "Over The Rainbow" tour
                                          with 'Faith Prince' (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of 'Harold Arlen' (qv), a tour
                                          that included Carnegie Hall.

                                       <p>Craig Stark grew up in a small town moving to Los Angeles at 18. Shortly thereafter,
                                          he worked for Marlon Brando as a bodyguard, where he learned an appreciation for the
                                          craft of acting. Jack Nicholson and Helena Kallianotes hired him next to build a notorious
                                          club. He made number of independent films as well as major roles on network television.
                                          After a sabbatical driven by musical aspirations in Joshua Tree, California, he returned
                                          to Los Angeles in 2011 to co-star in Allison Anders and Kurt Voss's new rock and roll
                                          film, "Strutter" and Quentin Tarantino's new western, "D'jango Unchained".

               <p>It's WWII, the battleground, Nazi-occupied France. The Nazis are doing whatever they
                  need to to flush out and exterminate Jews, the most proficient and prolific of the
                  Jew hunters being the sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa. As such, the American military
                  forms a unit, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine and comprised of eight Jews, to kill as
                  many Nazis as possible. Raine requests each of his men to bring him the scalp of at
                  least 100 Nazis apiece. He has his own method of ensuring that those Nazis he does
                  allow or need to let go free are scarred for life. In Paris in 1944, Joseph Goebbels,
                  the Nazi's chief propaganda master and filmmaker, plans to debut his latest film,
                  "Nation's Pride". The film, based on the victorious military exploits of Private Fredrick
                  Zoller, stars Zoller as himself. Because of his attraction to its pretty proprietress
                  Emmanuelle Mimieux, Zoller convinces Goebbels and the Nazi brass to hold the premiere
                  at Mimieux's cinema. Landa is to act as chief of security for the event. When the
                  Americans get wind of the screening and the fact that most of the Nazi highers-up
                  will be in attendance, Raine's team is tasked with blowing up the cinema during the
                  screening. They are assisted by renowned German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark,
                  who has been working as a spy for the British. They believe luck is on their side
                  when they learn that Hitler himself is scheduled to attend. Beyond being found out,
                  Raine's team face two as of yet unknown issues. The first is Mimieux, who is really
                  Shoshanna Dreyfus, a Jew who saw her family brutally murdered by Landa four years
                  earlier, and who may have her own plans for Landa and the Nazis. The second is Landa,
                  who beyond his up front mission, has another more personal mission for his life post-war
                  unknown to anyone but himself.

                                       <p>Diane Kruger was born Diane Heidkrüger in Algermissen, near Hildesheim, Germany. She
                                          studied ballet with the Royal Ballet in London before an injury ended her career.
                                          She returned to Germany and became a top fashion model. She later pursued acting and
                                          relocated to Paris at the suggestion of filmmaker 'Luc Besson' (qv) (_The Fifth Element
                                          (1997)_ (qv)). She married French actor 'Guillaume Canet' (qv) (_The Beach (2000/I)_
                                          (qv)) in 2001.

                                       <p>Brad Pitt was born on December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma and raised in Springfield,
                                          Missouri. His mother's name is Jane Etta Hillhouse. His father, William (Bill) Pitt,
                                          worked in management at a trucking firm in Springfield. He has a younger brother,
                                          Douglas (Doug) Pitt and a younger sister Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School,
                                          Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt
                                          attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on
                                          advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits
                                          short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting,
                                          Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing
                                          as a giant chicken while working for "el Pollo Loco".

                                       <p>Eli Roth began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scott's
                                          _Alien (1979)_ (qv) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director.
                                          With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood and his father's power tools, he
                                          made over fifty short films before attending film school at N.Y.U., where he won a
                                          student Academy Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1994. He worked in film and
                                          theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production
                                          assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20 Roth
                                          was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full
                                          time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films _A Price Above
                                          Rubies (1998)_ (qv) and _Illuminata (1998)_ (qv) and often worked as a stand-in, where
                                          he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that
                                          would eventually become _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) with friend 'Randy Pearlstein' (qv),
                                          and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth
                                          left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for
                                          his animation series _"Chowdaheads" (1999)_ (qv). Roth and friend 'Noah Belson' (qv)
                                          (_Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv)'s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth
                                          produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.'s #1 rated
                                          series _"WCW Monday Nitro" (1995)_ (qv) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they
                                          were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up
                                          a stop motion series called _The Rotten Fruit (2003) (V)_ (qv) which he produced,
                                          directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between
                                          the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director 'David Lynch (I)' (qv),
                                          producing content for the website davidlynch.com. In 2001, Roth filmed _Cabin Fever
                                          (2002)_ (qv) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his
                                          producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war
                                          at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion's Gate, instantly doubling
                                          their investors' money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion's
                                          Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical
                                          acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers
                                          as 'Peter Jackson (I)' (qv), 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Tobe Hooper' (qv) . Roth
                                          used the film's success to launch a slew of projects, including Scavenger Hunt, a
                                          teen comedy he will write and direct for Universal Studios, and The Box, a horror
                                          thriller he is co-writing with 'Richard Kelly (I)' (qv) that Roth will also direct.
                                          In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers 'Boaz Yakin' (qv), 'Scott Spiegel
                                          (I)' (qv), and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a new production
                                          company that will produce 3-5 intense, scary, lower budget horror films annually.

                                       <p>Léa Seydoux was born in Paris, France in 1985, to Valérie (Schlumberger) and Henri
                                          Seydoux. Her grandfather, Jérôme Seydoux, is chairman of Pathé, and her father is
                                          a great-grandson of businessman and inventor Marcel Schlumberger (her mother also
                                          descends from the Schlumberger family). Her parents are both of mixed French and Alsatian
                                          German descent, with more distant Spanish-Venezuelan roots on her father's side. In
                                          2009, she was nominated for the César Award for Most Promising Actress for her role
                                          in the film The Beautiful Person. She has been cast in a number of notable American
                                          films such as Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and Brad
                                          Bird's Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. As a special prize for their roles in
                                          Blue Is the Warmest Color, Seydoux and co-star Adèle Exarchopoulos were awarded the
                                          Palme d'Or alongside director Abdellatif Kechiche. Along with Jane Campion, Seydoux
                                          and Exarchopoulos are the only women to have ever won a Palme d'Or.

                                       <p>Born in Munich in 1969, Gedeon was raised bilingual (English &amp; German). He was sent
                                          to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school
                                          at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his
                                          second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood
                                          and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German
                                          Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual
                                          upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version.
                                          Gedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped
                                          out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for
                                          2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side.
                                          In 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the
                                          motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup.
                                          Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film
                                          award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman,
                                          Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German
                                          Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful
                                          television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action
                                          series, sold to over 120 territories). in 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish
                                          boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture
                                          The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the
                                          biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky)
                                          in Quentin Tarantino's new movie Inglorious Basterds.

                                       <p>Suave and handsome Australian actor who came to Hollywood in the 1950s, and built
                                          himself up from a supporting actor into taking the lead in several well-remembered
                                          movies. Arguably his most fondly remembered role was that as George (Herbert George
                                          Wells), the inventor, in 'George Pal' (qv)'s spectacular _The Time Machine (1960)_
                                          (qv). As the movie finished with George, and his best friend Filby 'Alan Young (I)'
                                          (qv) seemingly parting forever, both actors were brought back together in 1993 to
                                          film a 30 minute epilogue to the original movie! Taylor's virile, matinée idol looks
                                          also assisted him in scoring the lead of Mitch Brenner in 'Alfred Hitchcock (I)' (qv)'s
                                          creepy thriller _The Birds (1963)_ (qv), the role of 'Jane Fonda' (qv)'s love interest
                                          in _Sunday in New York (1963)_ (qv), the title role in 'John Ford (I)' (qv)'s biopic
                                          of Irish playwright 'Sean O'Casey' (qv) in _Young Cassidy (1965)_ (qv), and a co-starring
                                          role in _The Train Robbers (1973)_ (qv) with 'John Wayne (I)' (qv). Taylor also appeared
                                          as 'Bette Davis' (qv) future son-in-law in the well-received film _The Catered Affair
                                          (1956)_ (qv). He also gave a sterling performance as the German-American Nazi Major
                                          trying to fool 'James Garner (I)' (qv) in _36 Hours (1965)_ (qv). Later Taylor made
                                          many westerns and action movies during the 1960s and 1970s; however, none of them
                                          were much better than "B pictures" and failed to push his star to the next level.
                                          Aditionally, Taylor was cast as the lead in several TV series including _"Bearcats!"
                                          (1971)_ (qv), _"Masquerade" (1983)_ (qv), and _"Outlaws" (1986)_ (qv); however, none
                                          of them truly ignited viewer interest, and they were canceled after only one or two
                                          seasons. Most fans would agree that Rod Taylor's last great role was in the wonderful
                                          Australian film _The Picture Show Man (1977)_ (qv), about a traveling side show bringing
                                          "moving pictures" to remote towns in the Australian outback.

                                       <p>Mélanie Laurent was born in Paris, France. She is the daughter of Annick, a ballet
                                          teacher, and Pierre, a voice actor, who is most recognized for the French version
                                          of _"The Simpsons" (1989)_ (qv). She also has a younger brother, Mathieu. In 1998,
                                          she was visiting the set of _Astérix &amp; Obélix contre César (1999)_ (qv) with a friend
                                          when she caught the attention of 'Gérard Depardieu' (qv). He offered her a role in
                                          his next film _Un pont entre deux rives (1999)_ (qv). She only played a small role,
                                          but it was enough to further Mélanie's interest in acting.

                                       <p>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz,
                                          a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother
                                          was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow
                                          Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse
                                          in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to
                                          New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first
                                          wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London. During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily
                                          in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work
                                          in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however,
                                          attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has
                                          stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting.
                                          For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner. It was not until
                                          he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel
                                          Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in
                                          German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning
                                          actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix
                                          d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and
                                          the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award. Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles.
                                          His partner is the costume builder Judith Holste.

                  is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop
                  her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility
                  by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic
                  responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she
                  goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs
                  over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as
                  Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye
                  system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate,
                  which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet
                  army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet
                  missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.

                                       <p>Famke Beumer Janssen was born on November 5, 1964 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and has
                                          two other siblings. She studied economics for a year at the University of Amsterdam.
                                          Moving to America in 1984, Famke modeled for Chanel in New York City. Later, taking
                                          a break from modeling, she majored in writing and literature at Columbia University
                                          and studied acting with 'Harold Guskin' (qv). She then went to Los Angeles, California,
                                          where she continued to study acting under 'Roy London' (qv). Her first film was the
                                          crime drama _Fathers &amp; Sons (1992)_ (qv), where she played the love interest of 'Jeff
                                          Goldblum' (qv). Later, she became James Bond's enemy in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) opposite
                                          'Pierce Brosnan' (qv). Famke received strong critical acclaim for her electrifying
                                          performance as the femme fatale Xenia Onatopp. Her career has bloomed since then with
                                          her starring in such films as _House on Haunted Hill (1999)_ (qv), a reoccurring role
                                          on FX's _"Nip/Tuck" (2003)_ (qv) and the blockbuster trilogy _X-Men (2000)_ (qv),
                                          _X2 (2003)_ (qv), and _X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)_ (qv).

                                       <p>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support
                                          in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself
                                          noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and
                                          then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall
                                          (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption
                                          &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing
                                          a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick
                                          (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed
                                          the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which
                                          led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied"
                                          (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy
                                          roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians
                                          etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a

                                       <p>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer.
                                          In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked
                                          up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him
                                          from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for
                                          Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test,
                                          and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also
                                          failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for
                                          the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn
                                          thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and
                                          meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his
                                          acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid
                                          1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and
                                          Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned
                                          to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time,
                                          his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division
                                          of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and
                                          many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side,
                                          figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones
                                          there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At
                                          one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next
                                          morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation
                                          of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it,
                                          a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing
                                          of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other
                                          people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to
                                          London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia
                                          with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions
                                          Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live
                                          and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli'
                                          (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down.
                                          Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_
                                          (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of
                                          _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film,
                                          _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical
                                          abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd
                                          love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they
                                          should have put me out to grass a long time ago."

                                          Throughout childhood, Ravil attended classes in music, ballet, theater, as well as
                                          going for sports - ice hockey, boxing and soccer among them. After completing his
                                          2 years national service in the Soviet Air Force, Ravil worked for two seasons in

                                       <p>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating
                                          society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two
                                          James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise. He was born Anthony Robert McMillan
                                          on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian
                                          McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother,
                                          Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and
                                          cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12
                                          he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry
                                          V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).
                                          He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied
                                          art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a
                                          documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the
                                          Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his
                                          love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh
                                          Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre. In 1980
                                          Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The
                                          Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in
                                          _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as
                                          Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director
                                          'Amos Poe' (qv). He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip
                                          series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_
                                          (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane
                                          had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew
                                          to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years,
                                          Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn. In 1988 Coltrane
                                          met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer,
                                          and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading
                                          role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series
                                          _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv). He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB
                                          man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called
                                          him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane
                                          hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv)
                                          as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films. In early
                                          1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred
                                          in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges
                                          his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey
                                          across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His
                                          interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding
                                          and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire,
                                          Scotland, UK.

                                       <p>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England
                                          domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley
                                          114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University
                                          and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow
                                          Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting.
                                          On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in 'Richard III'), the
                                          Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in 'As You Like It', Edgar in 'King Lear')in 'The Caretaker'
                                          at the Bristol Old Vic, 'Live Like Pigs' at the Royal Court and 'The Park' with the
                                          Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.
                                          On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have
                                          played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.

                                       <p>Born in the northern Polish town of Bialystok, 'Izabella Scorupco' (qv) moved to Sweden
                                          with her mother as a young child. She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered
                                          by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_
                                          (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden
                                          and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages. In
                                          1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop

                                       <p>Sean Bean, England's most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium
                                          for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful,
                                          green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays
                                          angst-ridden villians, as in "Clarissa," passionate lovers like Mellors in "Lady Chatterley's
                                          Lover," rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as
                                          the emotionally torn Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings," and noble Greeks, like Odysseus
                                          in "Troy," where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest
                                          of the movie. Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," where as the principal
                                          lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically
                                          acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of
                                          movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys
                                          raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In
                                          his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK,
                                          and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, "I don't have any problems with women
                                          seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?" Well, good to know, because

                                       <p>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County
                                          Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability
                                          to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when
                                          Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close
                                          relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The
                                          death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him
                                          with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and
                                          Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second
                                          wife, 'Keely Shaye Smith' (qv).

                                       <p>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived
                                          nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family
                                          (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William
                                          soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan's dad took
                                          up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up.
                                          He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing
                                          in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club
                                          and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and
                                          4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he
                                          worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee.
                                          There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, "Tops", and was also the "Young Alan"
                                          who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the
                                          Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a
                                          B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed
                                          a cabaret double act with fellow student 'Forbes Masson' (qv) called Victor and Barry,
                                          which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of
                                          the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House
                                          as part of an Australian tour), records ("Hear Victor and Barry and Faint", "Are We
                                          Too Loud?") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made
                                          his professional theater and film debuts in "Macbeth" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow
                                          and in 'Gillies MacKinnon' (qv)'s "Passing Glory". After graduating Alan worked extensively
                                          in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _"Take the
                                          High Road" (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when "Conquest of the South Pole",

                                          in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award
                                          nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988. Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare
                                          Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in "Accidental Death
                                          of an Anarchist", which he also adapted with director 'Tim Supple' (qv). The production
                                          was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy

                                          (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with 'Sandrine Bonnaire' (qv) and 'Bruno Ganz' (qv).
                                          The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor
                                          award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In
                                          the same year he made two films for the BBC - _"Screen Two" (1985) {The Last Romantics
                                          (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him
                                          the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier

                                          his performance in "Cabaret"--in the Daily Telegraph's performances of the year) and
                                          then immediately went on to play the Emcee in 'Sam Mendes (I)' (qv)' revival of "Cabaret"
                                          at the same venue (London's Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination
                                          for Best Actor in a Musical for "Cabaret", and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA
                                          Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination. In 1994 he made his first
                                          Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous
                                          Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_
                                          (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers,
                                          and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele's High School

                                          in 1998 to reprise his role in "Cabaret" on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were
                                          a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics' Circle, Theatre
                                          World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate's awards for his performance.
                                          Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent
                                          films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001's "Design for Living"
